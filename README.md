- 👋 Hi, I’m Angela. I'm a Licensed Professional Counselor Supervisor who just so happens to be really into data and looking for a change of career. I've worked with various programs over the years and have become very interested in the data behind them. This is the driving force behind my current goal of changing careers and going into the field of Data Science.
- 👀 I’m interested in data! I love all things data and I'm just starting to learn how coding and data can come together. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python 3 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing yet, but once I learn more, I'd love to collaborate!
